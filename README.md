Application to search for a 5-day weather forecast

## Description
Application can search for the weather forecast for the upcoming 5 days in different cities using input bar in the top left. A search history is saved below the input bar, which can be clicked to recall past searches. This list of searched cities is saved in the user's local storage, and will reload it when the site is accessed again later.
The default country is the United States of America.
Please note that there seems to be an issue with functionality in Microsoft Edge that prevents the deployed application from functioning, however it will work locally or in Google Chrome.
